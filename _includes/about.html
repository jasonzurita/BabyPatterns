              <br/>
              <p>As new parents, we manually kept track of our baby's feedings to make sure our son was eating often / long enough and to make sure we had enough milk supply. Tired, and with many other things to keep track of, we started looking for a baby feeding tracker app. Sadly, we ended our search defeated by the available options; they were difficult to learn and use, had limited or no ways to review our baby's feedings, and in some cases were so packed full of <i>stuff</i> that we didn't know where to start.</p>
              <p>With our desire to focus on caring for our baby and to avoid the hassle of the available apps, we began working on a solution! As we worked on our solution, we made sure to focus on the previous pain points that we experienced — our solution needed to be easy to learn and use, give us the history and statistics that we needed to better care for our baby, and not break the bank.</p>
              <p>We are excited to share our new baby to help you as well — Baby Patterns!</p>
